# 🧬 dotfiles

Multiplatform configuration files

## 📦 Requirements

Each module requires its related application to be useful, obviously.  Outside
of that, "installing" the dotfiles has its own set of requirements.

Though, I might use this as an excuse to learn python, simplifying requirements.

### 🐧 Linux/WSL

- Bash v5.1 or newer
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)

### 🪟 Windows

- PowerShell 7.4.3 or newer
- [PowerShell-YAML Module](https://github.com/cloudbase/powershell-yaml)

## ✅ TODO

- Write installer scripts
  - Bash
  - PowerShell
  - Python?
- Add configs
  - Windows Terminal
  - VSCode
  - etc.
